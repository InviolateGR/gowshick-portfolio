          <p>
            Iâ€™m Gowshick, a final-year ECE student from Coimbatore. I specialize in Embedded Systems and IoT,
            and also enjoy working on creative UI/UX projects and web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy solving real-world problems by blending hardware with software, and am currently working on a
            smart vehicle black box system as my final year project.
